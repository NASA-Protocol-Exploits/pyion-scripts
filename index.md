# :snake:  PyION Scripts
PyION has proven to be a valuable tool in sending and receiving data across BP, LTP and CFDP inside the ION-DTN environment, as well as a limited and still experimental set of administrative functions to modify the ION configuration during runtime. This repository has been dedicated to PyION scripts made for the ION-DTN enviroment.
